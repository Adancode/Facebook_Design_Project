# Facebook_Design_Project
This is my Facebook design teardown and mockup, completed as part of the prep work for the Viking Code School.  Included are:

1.   UX teardown for Facebook.
2.   Design teardowns for 5 Facebook pages.
3.   Visual hierarchy sketches for those same 5 Facebook pages.
4.   Balsamiq Mockups, saved in pdf format (so that viewers without a copy of Balsamiq can see them), for those same 5 Facebook pages.
